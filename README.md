# Is it possible to predict star ratings on Yelp?

In this project, I will test whether different predictors (business attributes, opening hours, review count) can be uses to predict the star rating of a business.

The tools I will use are: Python, pandas, statsmodels, sci-kit learn and Matplotlib.

The model I will use is ordinal regression.
